                <section class ="article-view">
                    <p>Let me burn a sacred cow right now. You are not broken. You are not some wounded thing that needs
                        constant tweaking, fixing, or purifying.</p>

                    <p>What you need is a mirror. What you need is a fire. What you need… is permission to roar.</p>

                    <h2>Self-Help Is the New Cage</h2>
                    <p>They sell you the illusion that you’re healing while keeping you tame. You go from book to book,
                        course
                        to course, coach to coach — and for what?</p>
                    <p>To “become better”? No. To become smaller. Softer. Safer. More digestible.</p>
                    <p>Self-help isn’t helping if all it’s doing is convincing you that you’re not ready yet...</p>

                    <h2>You Don’t Need to Be Fixed — You Need to Be Felt</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever screamed into a pillow? Sobbed until your ribs rattled? Cursed the universe with
                        shaking
                        fists?</p>
                    <p>That’s healing. That’s real.</p>

                    <p>You don’t need more polishing. You need to be witnessed in your contradictions — in your shadow
                        and
                        your chaos.</p>
                    <blockquote>“You don’t own me anymore.”</blockquote>

                    <h2>“Good Girl” Programming Dies Hard</h2>
                    <p>From day one, you were told to behave. To be polite. To stay small. To apologize for your fire.
                    </p>
                    <p>But comfort isn’t transformation. It’s stagnation.</p>

                    <h2>Act Now. Not When You're “Ready”</h2>
                    <p>You’ve been taught to wait until you’re “healed,” “whole,” or “high-vibe” enough before you move.
                    </p>
                    <p>You don’t become powerful by waiting. You become powerful by choosing. Right now. In this breath.
                        In
                        the mess.</p>

                    <h2>You're Not a Project. You're a Portal</h2>
                    <p>You were never meant to be managed. You were meant to be felt, feared, followed, or rejected —
                        but
                        not tamed.</p>
                    <p>You’re not here to perfect your mindset. You’re here to crack reality open.</p>

                    <p>The ones who change the world aren’t those with the cleanest aura. They’re the ones who move
                        while
                        still bleeding.</p>

                    <h2>So Here's What I Dare You To Do</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Burn your need to be liked.</li>
                        <li>Unfollow the accounts that make you feel like you’re “behind.”</li>
                        <li>Rage without apology.</li>
                        <li>Create while crying.</li>
                        <li>Teach from the wound, not the scar.</li>
                        <li>Let the contradictions be sacred.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>And most of all… Stop fixing. Start unleashing.</strong></p>
                    <p>Because you were never broken. You were just bound.</p>
