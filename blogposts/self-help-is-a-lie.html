            <p>Let me burn a sacred cow right now. You are not broken. You are not some wounded thing that needs
                constant tweaking, fixing, or purifying.</p>

            <p>What you need is a mirror. What you need is a fire. What you need… is permission to roar.</p>

            <h2>Self-Help Is the New Cage</h2>
            <p>They sell you the illusion that you’re healing while keeping you tame. You go from book to book, course
                to course, coach to coach — and for what?</p>
            <p>To “become better”? No. To become smaller. Softer. Safer. More digestible.</p>
            <p>Self-help isn’t helping if all it’s doing is convincing you that you’re not ready yet...</p>

            <h2>You Don’t Need to Be Fixed — You Need to Be Felt</h2>
            <p>Have you ever screamed into a pillow? Sobbed until your ribs rattled? Cursed the universe with shaking
                fists?</p>
            <p>That’s healing. That’s real.</p>

            <p>You don’t need more polishing. You need to be witnessed in your contradictions — in your shadow and your
                chaos.</p>
            <blockquote>“You don’t own me anymore.”</blockquote>

            <h2>“Good Girl” Programming Dies Hard</h2>
            <p>From day one, you were told to behave. To be polite. To stay small. To apologize for your fire.</p>
            <p>But comfort isn’t transformation. It’s stagnation.</p>

            <h2>Act Now. Not When You're “Ready”</h2>
            <p>You’ve been taught to wait until you’re “healed,” “whole,” or “high-vibe” enough before you move.</p>
            <p>You don’t become powerful by waiting. You become powerful by choosing. Right now. In this breath. In the
                mess.</p>

            <h2>You're Not a Project. You're a Portal</h2>
            <p>You were never meant to be managed. You were meant to be felt, feared, followed, or rejected — but not
                tamed.</p>
            <p>You’re not here to perfect your mindset. You’re here to crack reality open.</p>

            <p>The ones who change the world aren’t those with the cleanest aura. They’re the ones who move while still
                bleeding.</p>

            <h2>So Here's What I Dare You To Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Burn your need to be liked.</li>
                <li>Unfollow the accounts that make you feel like you’re “behind.”</li>
                <li>Rage without apology.</li>
                <li>Create while crying.</li>
                <li>Teach from the wound, not the scar.</li>
                <li>Let the contradictions be sacred.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>And most of all… Stop fixing. Start unleashing.</strong></p>
            <p>Because you were never broken. You were just bound.</p>
